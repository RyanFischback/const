Welcome to the [const](link will be here) codebase, the website that can

## What is Const?

Const is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project where
it is built dynamically so that regardless of the database it will render
in an effective manner. As long as the guidelines for data input are followed as there are
not currently any plans for switching between themes.
