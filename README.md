Welcome to the [const](link will be here) codebase, the website that can
be reused for showcasing a business, a portfolio, or just an ordinary image gallery. The primary goals and direction will focus on
ensuring reusability, scalability, and stability.

## What is Const?

Const is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project where
it only relies on data to render components dynamically. 
As long as the guidelines for data input are followed because there are
not currently any plans for switching between themes and the frontend components will be created based on database data and have ZERO hard coding.
