## What is Const?

Const is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project where
it only relies on data to render components dynamically. (kind of ironic, i know)

## Getting Started

If you want to use const you need to clone it locally and have node installed. Run "npm install" in the root and frontend folder to add the node_modules. 

The way this project works is you setup your own database in the .env (has to be mongodb cloud). The project will connect to your database after you create it and update the .env link to that database.

The data for your projects needs to be input into the database as follows:

Projects:
name: string
description: string
imageUrl: string

You can also check out the models folder in case it's been updated since this was written to see how the tables should be formatted since they will be rendered in the frontend according to the models.

Once you have some projects you should be good to go! Enjoy and feel free to contribute by creating pull requests
